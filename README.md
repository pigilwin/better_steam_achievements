# Better Steam Achievements

## Things that need to be done
 - [ ] Add the list of achievements to the game page
 - [ ] Allow games to be hidden based on a selector
 - [ ] Display a progress bar to show how far we have completed the game?
 - [ ] Add a 10 remaining achievements games to go?

## Things to note so I don't forget
 - `import.meta.env.VITE_` variables are replaced with the variable in question, this happens in dev and build.
